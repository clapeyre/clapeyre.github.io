## What's this for?

This page is meant to gather the various resources I find on the topic of
Deep Learning.

## Learning about Deep Learning

I gave a [talk](http://typhon.cerfacs.fr/videos/?video=MEDIA170627163436093)
recently at CERFACS which can give you some ideas. The
[slides]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/JUN27_Talk_Deep_Learning.pdf) are also avaiable.

### Neural Nets

Introductory material:

  - [THE BOOK](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/). Just read this, it's great.
  - [Another good (partial) web book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).
  - [An intuitive explanation of convnets](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/).
  - The [GIMP user manual](https://docs.gimp.org/en/plug-in-convmatrix.html) shows what image convolution does.
  - [A 3D visualization of the MNIST net activation](http://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/).
  - [Really cool blog with visualrepresnetations of neural nets](https://colah.github.io/).
  - [Good slides by Yann LeCun](http://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/spring17/lec01_cnn_architectures.pdf).
  - [Various grouped resources](http://yerevann.com/a-guide-to-deep-learning/) from an Armenian lab.
  - A Google engineer did [a very big blog](https://shapeofdata.wordpress.com/introduction/) on this subject.

Hands-on:

  - [Awesome visual playgroud with Tensorflow](http://playground.tensorflow.org/)
  - [Tutorial for building Autoencoders in Keras](https://blog.keras.io/building-autoencoders-in-keras.html)

Generative Adversarial Networks:

  - [An introduction to GANs](http://blog.aylien.com/introduction-generative-adversarial-networks-code-tensorflow/)
  - [Super resolution using GAN](http://www.gitxiv.com/posts/5Z9gyGthtEhoroGzg/photo-realistic-single-image-super-resolution-using-a)
  - The hot stuff: [CycleGAN](https://hardikbansal.github.io/CycleGANBlog/)
  - [Super-Resolution Benchmark](https://github.com/huangzehao/Super-Resolution.Benckmark)

Style transfer:

  - [Long tutorial on style transfer](https://harishnarayanan.org/writing/artistic-style-transfer/)

### High Dimension

  - [Hands on with high dimension](https://martin-thoma.com/average-distance-of-points/)

## Deep Learning results

  - [Current state of the art objects classification results](https://rodrigob.github.io/are_we_there_yet/build/classification_datasets_results.html)

## Important Papers

  - [[1998] LeNet-5 for MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf)
  - [[2006] Deep Belief Nets](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/fastnc.pdf)
