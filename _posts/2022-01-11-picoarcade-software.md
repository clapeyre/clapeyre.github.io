This is part 2 of a series on the PicoArcade project. Check out the [main
page]({% post_url 2022-01-09-picoarcade %}) to see the full series.

Actually, I'm postponing writing this, because I'm not happy with my codebase
yet.  To put it simply: I had a lot of experience with Python when starting
this project, but none with micropython.  I had a lot to learn... Now that I've
made some progress this journey, there are many things I want to clean up
before considering this code as complete. When that happens, I'll come back and
talk about it.

In the meantime, if you want to dig in, here's [the code
base](https://github.com/clapeyre/pico-arcade).

That's all for this part! The [next post]({% post_url
2022-01-12-picoarcade-games %}) shows the dozen games I've built so far with
this setup.
