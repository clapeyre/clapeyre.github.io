This is part 2 of a series on the PicoArcade project. Check out the [main page]({% post_url 2022-01-09-picoarcade %}) to see the full series.

## Structure: Main menu / apps, drivers, libraries
## Fun with buttons
## More fun with async
## IDE Annoyances: VSCode and pico-go, rshell

That's all for this part! The [next post]({% post_url 2022-01-12-picoarcade-games %}) shows the dozen games I've built so far with this setup.
